# covid_project
This is the repository for my project on socioeconomic and environmental determinants of COVID-19. It includes the project notebook, where datasets were uploaded and cleaned (though some had already been cleaned and collated in Excel prior to uploading), as well as analysed in linear regression and multiple linear regression models.)
